  <p>I was born on 1982th, February the 5th in Jagodina, city in central Serbia. There I attended elementary school, and there for
    high school. From 2003 till now days, I worked in police force in Police Department of Subotica. I graduated on Academy of Criminalistic
    and Police Studies in Belgrade.

    I've always been interested in computers and the way they worked. All by myself I descovered functions on computers since from the
    time of my high school days. But it wasnâ€™t until 2019 that I took a programming course and so I learned partialy HMTL5, CSS, JS,
    PHP7 and MySQL. This is followed by refinement...</p>
